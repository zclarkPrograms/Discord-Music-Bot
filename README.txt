This discord bot allows the user to stream music from YouTube in a discord audio channel.
This bot also has a Reddit component that allows the user to get Reddit posts from a user-provided subreddit.
There is also an unfinished beat-edit feature that would have allowed the user to edit the YouTube music stream live. Currently it only allows for an audio file to be edited on the server computer.
