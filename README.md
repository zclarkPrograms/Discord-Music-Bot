# Discord Bot

## Features
This discord bot allows the user to stream music from YouTube in a discord audio channel.

This bot also has a Reddit component that allows the user to get Reddit posts from a user-provided subreddit.

Finally, there is also an unfinished beat-edit feature that would have allowed the user to edit the YouTube music stream live. Currently it only allows for an audio file to be edited on the server computer.


## Instructions

Before the bot is able to run, you must fill in the necessary Discord and Reddit information in the info.txt file:

- Discord
  - The Bot's token
  - The guild id of the Discord server in which the bot resides
- Reddit
  - Username
  - Password
  - Client ID
  - Client Secret
